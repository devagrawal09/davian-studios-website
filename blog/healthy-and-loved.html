          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Healthcare is a highly demanding industry in China. Ever since we started providing our services to people in need of care and people who can provide the care, we have been struggling to keep up with the amount of requests and resumes we have been receiving. In the beginning of 2018 we reached out to Davian Studios to assist our growing business. The application they built really helped us automate a lot of the management and communication between our customers. A lot of the times people will create a job posting, hire a caregiver, receive their service and complete the payment procedure without any kind of manual involvement on our side, and we love that. The fact that we have limited hands and time should not affect the quality of the service we provide and the people it reaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The explosion in the growth of our customers (as seen in the table above) would not have been possible without a digital system like this application.
